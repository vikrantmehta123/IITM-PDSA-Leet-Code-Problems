# Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python

This repository is a comprehensive resource for Leet Code problems. Here, you will find a solution explanations and code implementations for a carefully curated Leet Code problems based on the 
content of the PDSA Course for IITM BS in Data Science and Applications. 

The repository is divided into multiple markdown files which correspond to the weekly content of the rigorous PDSA course. The explanations of each of the algorithms used for solving the problems can be 
found [here](https://pdsaiitm.github.io/). Each page contains several problems from Leet Code ranging from easy to difficult. 

Here's an overview of the algorithms and the problems discussed in the repository:
### 1. Sorting and Searching Algorithms
These algorithms cover insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and binary search. The topics also cover the complexity analysis for each of the algorithms. 
The problems discussed in this file are:
##### 1.1 [Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum/description/)
##### 1.2 [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/)
##### 1.3 [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)
##### 1.4 [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)

### 2. Heaps, Stacks, Arrays, Linked Lists, and Hashing:
This file corresponds to the third week of the course. The topics discussed during this week covers the important data structures like Heaps, Stacks, Linked Lists, Arrays, and Hashing methods. Along with 
the data structures, the operations that we associate with these data structures and their complexity analysis is also illustrated. 

The problems discussed in this page are:
##### 2.1 [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)
##### 2.2 [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)
##### 2.3 [Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/description/)
##### 2.4 [Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/description/)
##### 2.5 [Reverse Nodes in K Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/)

### 3. Graphs, Traversal in Graphs, and Topological Sorting
This file corresponds to the fourth week of the course. The topics for this week provide an introduction to the graph data structure and their representation using adjacency lists and matrices. Along with this,
it covers the important traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS, and the topological sorting algorithm. 

The problems discussed in this page are:
##### 3.1 [Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/)
##### 3.2 [Course Schedule-I](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/)
##### 3.3 [Course Schedule-II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/)
##### 3.4 [Snakes and Ladders](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/description/)
##### 3.5 [Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-items-by-groups-respecting-dependencies/description/)
##### 3.6 [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/description/)
