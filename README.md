# üìö Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms Using Python

Welcome to the supplementary GitHub repository for the course **Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms Using Python (BSCS2002)** which is offered as part of the **IITM BS in Data Science and Applications** program. In this course, you build a strong foundation in programming, covering essential concepts in data structures and algorithms, using Python. You can find more information about the course [here](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSCS2002.html). There is also an [online textbook](https://pdsaiitm.github.io/) that you can use as reference throughout the course.

In this repository, you will find a solution explanations and code implementations for a carefully curated Leet Code problems that span the topics covered in the lectures. The problems are categorized such that they correspond to each week's course content. 

## üìù Overview of Course Topics:
- **Week 1**: Overview and recap of Python
- **Week 2**: Sorting and Searching Algorithms- Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.
- **Week 3**: Stacks, Heaps, Linked Lists, Arrays, and Hashing
- **Week 4**: Graph Algorithms- BFS, DFS, Topological Sorting, DAG
- **Week 5**: Graph Algorithms- Shortest Paths, Minimum Cost Spanning Trees
- **Week 6**: Union Find, Priority Queues, Heaps, Binary Search Trees
- **Week 7**: Balanced Search Trees, Greedy Algorithms- Huffman Coding, Interval Scheduling
- **Week 8**: Divide and Conquer- Quick Select, Closest Pair of Points, Counting Inversions
- **Week 9**: Dynamic Programming- Grid Paths, Edit Distance, Longest Common Subsequence
- **Week 10**: String Matching- Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp, KMP, Tries, Regular Expressions
- **Week 11**: Network Flows, Linear Programming, NP Hardness
- **Week 12**: Summary

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

This repository is organized into 12 directories, one for each week of the course. Inside each week's directory, you will find a file named `Questions.md` that contains:

- **üìù LeetCode Questions**: A list of problems to solve, relevant to the week's topics.
- **üß† Solution Approach**: An explanation of the thought process and strategies for solving the problems.
- **üîç Solution Code**: Python code solutions for the problems.

## üîé About the Problems

The problems selected from LeetCode cover a wide range of difficulties, from easy to hard. Each problem is chosen to reinforce the concepts learned during the week, providing both practice and a deeper understanding of the topics. You are encouraged to attempt the problems before looking at the solution approach and code.

## üôå Credits

This repository is a collaborative effort between the course instructors, teaching assistants, and the enthusiastic community of students. Special thanks to the instructors Atul PS Sir, Satyanarayana Sir for their continued support, and a shoutout to the creators of the LeetCode platform for providing a wealth of coding challenges. 

Happy coding! üöÄ
