# Leet Code Problems on Shortest Path and Minimum Cost Spanning Trees

## 1. [Min Cost To Connect All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/description/)

### 1.1 Minimum Cost Spanning Trees

- The question is asking for the minimum cost to connect all the points. Can you identify what type of a problem this is? It is a **MCST** problem!
- How can you convert the given points into a graph? Each point can represent a node in the graph. The edges are the distances between any two points in the graph. So, it will be a complete graph- where each node is connected to every other node with some cost.
- Run a nested loop:
    - For each point
        - For every other point, 
            - Compute the distance and store the edge in an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list

- Once we have the graph representation, we can run either or Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm on this graph to get the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree's edges. 
- To compute the minimum cost, iterate over the Tree edges and sum the edge weights

#### Code:
```
# This function is almost exact copy of the function given in the book, except we are summing the 
# cost of Tree Edges to return a minimum cost
def kruskal(WList):
    (edges,component,TE) = ([],{},[])
    for u in WList.keys():
        edges.extend([(d,u,v) for (v,d) in WList[u]])
        component[u] = u
    
    edges.sort()
   
    for (d,u,v) in edges:
        if component[u] != component[v]:
            TE.append((u,v, d))
            c = component[u]
            for w in WList.keys():
                if component[w] == c:
                    component[w] = component[v]
    # Compute the Minimum Cost based on Tree Edges
    min_cost = 0
    for u, v, d in TE:
        min_cost += d
    return(min_cost)

class Solution:
    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Init Adjacency Matrix
        AList = { i : [] for i in range(len(points))}
        # Compute distances for each point and store in AMat
        for i in range(len(points)):
            x1, y1 = points[i][0], points[i][1]
            for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
                x2, y2 = points[j][0], points[j][1]
                dist = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
                
                # Distance from point i to j is same as from j to i. So init both entries
                AList[i].append((j, dist))
                AList[j].append((i, dist))
        
        minimum_cost = kruskal(AList)
        return minimum_cost
```
